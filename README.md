# Navigate--SimpleWay
It was a simple project were we are navigate to any url.
So in this project, the only thing to see was the location.replace()

Simply location.replace() is one of the method or built-in function in javascript.
It job is to navigate to the new url. we provide the url on the replace('http://www.youtube.com/') this property
and it simply gonna navigate to there, and also replace the current entry in the browser's history with the new url we use.
means existing url get removed and new url get the entry in the browser history.
unlike we also have a location.assign() but this add a new entry to the browser.
